# Tree-files-Lin-et-al.-MPE
All the tree files in the paper ' Phylogenomic conflict resulting from ancient introgression following species diversification in Stewartia s.l. (Theaceae)' were deposited in this repository. 

For the plastid datasets, phylogenetic trees generated from complete plastome alignments were labeled  'complete_plastome_*' where * refers to ML/MP/BI. Same rule applies to plastid coding sequences(CDS) data.

For the nuclear datasets (i.e., data matrices generated from RAD-seq), phylogenetic trees were labeled 'DATASET_*' where DATASET was corresponding to same SNPs matrix in the paper under same name and * refers to SVDquartets (SVD for short) or ML approach.
